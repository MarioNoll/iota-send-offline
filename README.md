[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/looploooop/iota-cli-paper-wallet/master/LICENSE)

Single web page to create and send offline IOTA transactions.

## Features

- Create and send a transaction in 3 simple steps
- No need to expose your seed on an online device
- Private key reuse will be detected and prohibited

All Transactions will be handled by a proxy which comes with the following advantages:

- Remote Proof-of-Work (PoW)
- Transaction will be observed until it gets confirmed
- Including reattachments and promotions

As a downside the proxy charges a small fee. Typically around $0.01
to cover the costs of providing this service.
